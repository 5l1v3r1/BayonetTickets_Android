Bayonet Tickets - Android, is a mobile application which integrates into [Rocket.Chat](https://rocket.chat/) and provides IT based ticket creation support for field employees. 

Future integrations are planned for the [Bayonet Ticket Manager](https://github.com/starhound/Bayonet_Ticket_Manager). Currently the Ticket Manager does not support tickets from the Android application.

Once users submit a ticket, they can setup a time to meet with the IT department through the use of [Calendly](https://calendly.com/). 

This application can be customized to fit any need and repurposed to send tickets as emails over using Rocket.Chat as its central server.

See a screen shot of the application below:
